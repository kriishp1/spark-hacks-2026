# Parsley 🌿

**Never lose money on returns again.**

Parsley is an AI-powered receipt tracker that helps you remember return deadlines and warranty expirations before it's too late. Just snap a photo of your receipt, and we'll remind you when it matters.

## 💡 The Problem

We've all been there: you buy something with good intentions to return it if it doesn't work out. Life gets busy. Weeks pass. By the time you remember, the return window has closed. That money is gone—not because the store made returns difficult, but because life is chaotic and our brains aren't built to remember arbitrary deadlines.

Americans leave hundreds of dollars on the table each year through:
- Missed return windows
- Expired warranties they paid for
- Unused protection plans

**Parsley solves this.** One photo. Automatic tracking. Money back in your pocket.
